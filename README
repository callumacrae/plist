callumacrae's plist parser simply parses a plist file and returns an array of data found in the file. It is extremely easy to use; the following line of code is an example of how it works:

$array = plist::Parse('path/to/file');

DO NOT USE THE DEMO ON A LIVE SERVER. It can use a lot of resources, and is also vulnerable to XSS injection (kind of intentional to keep the script simpler.)
